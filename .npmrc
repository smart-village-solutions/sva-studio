# NPM Configuration File
# This file configures npm behavior for the smart-village-app/sva-studio project
#
# provenance: Enables npm provenance statements during package publishing
# When set to true, npm will generate and publish provenance attestations that cryptographically
# verify the package's source code origin and build process. This enhances supply chain security
# by providing transparent and verifiable metadata about where and how the package was built.
# Requires npm 9.5.0 or higher and a supported CI/CD environment.
