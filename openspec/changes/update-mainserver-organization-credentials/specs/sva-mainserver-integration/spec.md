## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Mainserver-Credential-Auflösung respektiert den aktiven Organisationskontext

The system SHALL resolve effective SVA Mainserver credentials from the active organization context before any server-side Mainserver adapter performs token acquisition or a GraphQL call. `contentAuthorPolicy` defines whether the adapter uses only organization credentials or falls back from the active organization to the current user's Keycloak-backed credentials.

#### Scenario: `org_only` uses only active organization credentials

- **GIVEN** a server-side Mainserver adapter resolves credentials for a request with `activeOrganizationId`
- **WHEN** the active organization's `contentAuthorPolicy` is `org_only`
- **THEN** the adapter uses only the credentials stored for that active organization
- **AND** it does not retry with user credentials if the organization credentials are missing or incomplete

#### Scenario: `org_or_personal` falls back to the current user

- **GIVEN** a server-side Mainserver adapter resolves credentials for a request with `activeOrganizationId`
- **WHEN** the active organization's `contentAuthorPolicy` is `org_or_personal`
- **AND** the active organization has no complete Mainserver credentials
- **THEN** the adapter falls back to the current user's Keycloak-backed credentials
- **AND** it continues to reject shared instance credentials or browser-provided credentials

#### Scenario: Missing organization credentials yield a deterministic org-scoped error

- **GIVEN** a server-side Mainserver adapter resolves credentials for a request with `activeOrganizationId`
- **WHEN** the active organization's `contentAuthorPolicy` is `org_only`
- **AND** the active organization has no complete Mainserver credentials
- **THEN** no upstream token or GraphQL request is started
- **AND** the adapter returns the deterministic error `organization_mainserver_credentials_missing`

### Requirement: Mainserver credential and token caches stay isolated per active organization context

The system SHALL include the active organization context in every credential and token cache key used by the SVA Mainserver integration so tokens from one organization context cannot be replayed in another context for the same user and instance.

#### Scenario: Same user switches between two organizations

- **GIVEN** the same authenticated user is a member of two organizations in the same instance
- **WHEN** the user performs Mainserver operations in organization A and then in organization B
- **THEN** credential resolution and token reuse are isolated by `activeOrganizationId`
- **AND** the integration does not reuse a token or credential cache entry from organization A inside organization B
